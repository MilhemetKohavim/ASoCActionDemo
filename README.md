# ASoCActionDemo
ASoCActionDemo a sample application used to demonstrate HCL AppScan CodeSweep and HCL AppScan on Cloud GitHub capabilities.

ASoCActionDemo is a Python application written purely for demonstration purposes and has known vulnerabilities, and is used to demonstrate the following capabilities. A description of the application is in Demo_ReadMe.txt. 


## 1. HCL AppScan CodeSweep

**HCL AppScan CodeSweep** is an HCL AppScan extension for Visual Studio Code provides Static Application Security Testing (SAST) functionality for detecting vulnerabilities early in the development life cycle. It's a lightweight, FREE extension for quickly and easily discovering vulnerabilites while you're writing code.

## 3. HCL ASoC SAST Workflow
**HCL ASoC SAST Workflow** performs a security scan against an entire codebase, triggered manually via Github Actions. The HCL ASoC SAST Workflow, in this application, is a modified version of the ASoC_Demo.
