# ASoCActionDemo
ASoCActionDemo is a sample application used to demonstrate HCL AppScan CodeSweep and HCL AppScan on Cloud GitHub capabilities.

ASoCActionDemo is a Python application written purely for demonstration purposes and has known vulnerabilities. A description of the application is in Demo_ReadMe.txt.


## 1. HCL AppScan CodeSweep

**HCL AppScan CodeSweep** is an HCL AppScan extension for Visual Studio Code provides Static Application Security Testing (SAST) functionality for detecting vulnerabilities early in the development life cycle. It's a lightweight, FREE extension for quickly and easily discovering vulnerabilites while you're writing code.

To use, simply clone this project and use Microsoft Visual Code and the HCL AppScan CodeSweep to scan for vulnerabilities. Resources are listed below.
